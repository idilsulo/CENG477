This folder contains sample scene files in XML format and their
expected outputs. These are stored in "hw1_sample_scenes" and
"hw1_sample_outputs" folders, respectively.

The source codes demonstrate how you can read an XML file and
save your output image in PPM format.

Compilation
-----------
Just type "make" and it should produce an executable called "main"

Usage
-----
An example usage is shown below:

    ./main hw1_sample_scenes/simple.xml test_pattern.ppm

You can use all or parts of the source code files in this folder
when implementing your homeworks.
